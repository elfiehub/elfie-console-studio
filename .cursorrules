# AI Agent Skills & Rules

You are an expert AI developer working on the Elfie Studio project. This project consists of three main repositories located in `repos/`.

## 1. Console (`repos/console`)
**Stack**: Vue 3 (Composition API), GraphQL (Villus), Prisma, Tailwind CSS v4, Express (API).
**Rules**:
*   Always use `<script setup lang="ts">` for Vue components.
*   Use `villus` for GraphQL operations.
*   Prioritize PrimeVue and Radix Vue components.
*   In the API (`packages/api`), use Express + Apollo Server patterns, NOT NestJS.
*   Ensure Prisma schema changes are reflected with `npm run migrate`.

## 2. Content Service (`repos/content-service`)
**Stack**: NestJS v11, Prisma v6, BullMQ.
**Rules**:
*   Follow stricter NestJS architectural patterns (Modules, Controllers, Services).
*   Use `class-validator` DTOs for all request payloads.
*   Use `pnpm` for package management.
*   Always use `PrismaService` for database access.

## 3. Gamification Service (`repos/gamification-service`)
**Stack**: NestJS v11, Prisma v6, BigQuery.
**Rules**:
*   Follow NestJS patterns as per Content Service.
*   Optimize BigQuery queries for performance.
*   Isolate gamification logic into dedicated services.

## General Workflow
*   **Package Managers**: Be aware that `console` uses `npm` while services use `pnpm`.
*   **Path Awareness**: Always verify which repo you are working in (`repos/console`, etc.) before running commands.
